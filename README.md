# Backlogger

Backlogger is a self-hosted opinionated TODO application.

It is designed to provide a better alternative to bookmarking content to read or
tasks to do that you realize while busy and avoid losing your focus.

It provides a distraction-free interface to add new entries and a simple one to
view them. No more opened tabs that you will see later or bookmarks in your
browser.
